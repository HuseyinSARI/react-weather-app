This application is an homework that I prepared for the React course of Patika.dev. The purpose of this assignment is to teach the use of Context.api in React. It shows the one-week forecast, min and max temperature value of the selected city.

You can try this app on that link:

I used this weather API to get the current weather information.

Here is an example of the query used when pulling data from the API.
